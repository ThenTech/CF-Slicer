# Computational Fabrication 3D model Slicer

> **Lieven Libberecht, William Thenaers**

## Minimal requirements

- [ ] Program with input STL/OBJ file and output [gcode](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code) file
- [ ] Basic GUI to go through slices step by step (+ render all paths in colors)
- [ ] Basic GUI for configuring essential parameters e.g. layer height, nozzle diameter, number of shells,â€¦
- [ ] Support for Shells + infill (basic e.g. rectangular) + roofs/floors
- [ ] Models can have holes!
- [ ] Support generation (basic zig-zag structure)
- [ ] Optimize for print quality (not speed)

## Possible extras
- [ ] Other types of infill
- [ ] Adaptive slicing
- [ ] Support for bridges (not requiring support) => nozzle cannot start in a void
- [ ] Optimizing paths for speed
- [ ] Support structures to avoid toppling of objects (e.g. cube standing on 1 corner)
- [ ] Automatic orientation of model (optimization)
- [ ] Optimized support structures

## Progress

- [ ] Algorithm + UI for basic slicing of 3D model (3D view for STL visualizer + 2D view for 
  showing slices)
  - [x] Basic 3D UI (William), uses:
    - [helix-toolkit](https://github.com/helix-toolkit/helix-toolkit) in a C# WPF 3D form
    - [clipper](http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php)
  - [x] Basic GCode writer (William)
- [ ] Erode perimeter with half the nozzle thickness (otherwise print will be too large)
- [ ] **[Deadline 14/11]** Generate g-code for a perimeter of a single slice and try 3D printing
- [ ] Extend data structure to support holes in object/polygon
- [ ] Generate second shell
- [ ] Generate basic rectangular infill structure (line per line intersection between grid and
  polygon slices)
- [ ] Extend g-code generation and 3D print simple object that does not require support 
  structure
- [ ] Calculate regions + generate paths (+ g-code) for floors and roofs
- [ ] Try 3D printing a closed object (roofs + floors) that does not require support
- [ ] Features + algorithms for support structure generation
- [ ] Implement all other minimal requirements (e.g. basic UI controls for settings)

## TODO

- [ ] Scale slider naar 1 dim
- [ ] ~~Sliders met textfield voor manual input~~ (of sliders weg en enkel [real scale; percentage])
- [ ] Clipper (polygon intersection etc)?
- [ ] 2de viewport voor 1 slice te previewen => met slider voor slice te selecteren
- [ ] Slice preview met kleuraanduiding in object of bovenkant object wegnemen om slice te zien
- [x] Nozzle thickness parameter
- [ ] Indicatie van grootte
- [x] XY translate en rotate
- [ ] Slice opstellen door uinion van vlak met dikte NozzleThickness en object (met Clipper?)
- [x] Add ambient light ~~
